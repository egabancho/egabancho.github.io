        Hi, I'm Esteban!
    </p>
    <p class="my-6">
    I am a software engineer with 10+ years of experience in full-stack development, operations, and project management.
    In my previous jobs, I have always worked and led relatively small and cohesive teams. This situation allowed us to cover many aspects of software development, from fixing production bugs on our code or services to developing new features for our software stack without forgetting about dealing with user requests.
    </p>
    <p class="my-6">
    I have worked for a small startup called Fanalytical for the past few years. As in any emerging startup, our team is relatively small. This has pushed me to step outside my comfort zone and made me learn multiple new things, many of which are UI-related. One of the things that excite me the most about this position is the fact that I can take the next step toward the UI and actually build something that people like me can use and enjoy.
    </p>
    
    <p class="my-6">
    Before Fanalytical, I used to work at CERN. There, I led a small team of great people to build what today has become videos.cern.ch. As part of my daily work there, I collaborated with a bigger team to design and build the library that powers this site (and several others inside and outside CERN), Invenio. During my time there, I appreciated the positive impact an open-source community has on the product. I established long-lasting relationships with some of the external contributors; I am still a maintainer of a few extensions and enjoy helping whenever I can in the form of bug fixes, new contributions, or helping others on the forums.
    </p>
    
    <p class="my-6">
    All in all, I know that you are seeking the brightest and most creative
    applicant for this position, and I understand that my skills might not align 100%. Still, I also know that I can perform the job effectively with perseverance, dedication, and rigorousness. I believe that my previous experience makes me a great addition to your team.
    </p>
    
    <p class="my-6">
    Thank you for taking the time to review my resume. I genuinely believe this is a position where my knowledge, experience, and passion will make me a valuable asset to the Tailwind team.
    </p>
